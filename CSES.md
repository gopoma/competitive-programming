# CSES Problem Set

## Introductory Problems

* __Digit Queries:__ Binary Search on rightmost number that could contain the kth digit.

## Sorting and Searching

* __Josephus Problem I:__ Simulation with `<ext/rope>`.

* __Factory Machines:__ Binary Search on answer, be careful with **overflows**.

```C++
// kills the program on integer overï¬‚ows (but is really slow).
#pragma GCC optimize ("trapv")
```

* __Sum of Three Values:__ `Hashing` or `Two Pointers Technique`, for Hashing, combine the type definitions of the cp-book and chash from kactl, for Two Pointers Technique, follow the steps that the Competitive Programming Handbook describes in Amortized analysis chapter for 2SUM problem (page 78).
