# To Take into Consideration

* Some statements gets simplified if you `fix` something.

* Try to write a simplified formula if you can, to avoid using something that you don't know.

* `Try` to simulate `all` the test cases in paper.

* `Don't overthink`, maybe it is not as complicated as you think!

* Try `Proof by AC`.

* No divagues >:v.

```C++
// Rotate vector left 3 times.
int rotL = 3;

// rotate function
rotate(vec1.begin(), vec1.begin() + rotL, vec1.end());

// go

// Rotate vector right 4 times.
int rotR = 4;

// rotate function
rotate(vec2.begin(), vec2.begin() + vec2.size() - rotR, vec2.end());
```

* `Complexity in Recursive dp`: Complejidad que acarrea la tabla en sí por la Complejidad de un cálculo simple de estado.

* It is my impression that Pull dp is best for counting.

* Think in `invariants`.

* `Always analyze constraints`.
